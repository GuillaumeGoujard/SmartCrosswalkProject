# SmartCrosswalkProject

This package aims at simulating the detection bins of micro-radars at a smart crosswalk with respect to a pedestrian trajectory and aims at finding the best arrangement for micro-radars to maximize the detection score.

Code and report completed for Fall 2019. 

Funding for this project was provided by UC Berkeley Safe Transportation and Research Education Center (SafeTREC) and the Collaborative Sciences Center for Road Safety (CSCRS), a U.S. Department of Transportation-funded National University Transportation Center led by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hillâ€™s Highway Safety Research Center.
